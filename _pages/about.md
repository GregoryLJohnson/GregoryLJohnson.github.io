I am a bit of a mutt, the term for which was "sooner" where I grew up - sooner this than that. I got my PhD in 2023 studying universal aspects of phase transitions, particularly some newly appreciated features relevant to the QCD phase diagram. I brushed up against some conformal field theory which also peaked my interest. Extending my PhD work in a handful of directions may never happen for me, but it is still tempting.

Basic statistical models, one of which being the Ising model, also seem to be pretty rich - the particular contexts in which the were developed, the developement of analytical and numerical methods to study them, and the wealth of mathematics they contain.

I am also just getting interested in machine learning (which I'd prefer to call statisitcal learning, to emphasis it's proper context). There's tons of fun to be had here in a similar vein as the others.

Anyways, I am using this blog as a tool to both help me document my studies/research and engage with material through writing for a (likely non-existent) audience.
