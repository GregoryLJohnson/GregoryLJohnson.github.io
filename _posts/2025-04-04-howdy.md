# Welcome to my experiment
I am starting a blog to experiment with documenting my scattered explorations.

Topics you might see here:
- Statistical physics, field theory, critical phenomenon, renormalization
- Computational physics
- Statistics, machine learning
- Random math (differential geometry, logic, Hilbert spaces, ...)
- Music and music theory
- History about any of these topics
